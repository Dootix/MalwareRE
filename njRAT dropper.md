- Observed sample "NursultanNextgen.exe" - during the ANY.RUN analysis two things are visible instantly:
  1. Creation of "server.exe" in C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp directory.
  2. Adding "server.exe" to firewall's allowed programs list.
- "server.exe" being marked as njRAT -> https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.njrat

## Sample analysis

- DIE verdict - malware marked as .NET executable. We will have to use dnSpy to analyze the C# code.

- Malware is obfuscated with "Fransesco" namespace.
