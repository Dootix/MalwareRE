- Two topmost variables encoded in hex, separated by exclamation point.
- They are then converted to int -> then represented as bytes as $bbb and $pe.
- $pe (second hex var) loaded as assembly via Reflection.Assembly from .NET
- `$gss = $YIX.GetType('NewPE.PE' -replace '', '')`: This line retrieves the type named `'NewPE.PE'` from the loaded assembly using reflection.
- $IRW is assigned an Execute method from $gss type.
- $ODW is constructed to point to NET Framework's RegSvcs.exe directory.
- $WYZU is an array with $ODW and $bbb as its elements.
- `$IUWS` is assigned the result of invoking the 'Execute' method from `$gss`, passing `$null` as the instance on which the method should be invoked and an array of parameters contained in `$WYZU`.
- Finally, te script's content is written to "C:\Users\Public\libraries.ps1".

- Creates a batch script. It first disables echoing of invoked commands.
- Sets ps as powershell.exe
- sets params for PowerShell.
- sets cmd's env variable with file's location -> C:\Users\Public\libraries.bat
- Runs the Powershell with provided parameters above.
- Last line creates the above-described batch file.

- First, it creates Wscript.Shell and gets the batch file's path to run it when invoked.
- Creates libraries.vbs script with above params.
- Then, creates COM-object to create a scheduled task.
- Scheduled task is created to run **libraries.vbs(which runs libraries.bat, which runs libraries.ps1)** every 2 minutes.
- Gets the root folder of the task scheduler.
- Sets Task definition as **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate** to masquerade as legitimate process.
